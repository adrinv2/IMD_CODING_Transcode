# Artefact
In a box in the IISG archive, there is a box. This box contains a single

## Metadata
| Tag | Data |  
|--|--|
**IISG Call Number** | [IISG BG K21/985](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/1109411)
| **Physical Description** | 16 keys
| **Type** | Object
| **Medium** | Tool/device
| **Materials** | Copper, Steel, Iron
| **Date** | prior to 1936
|![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/keys5.png)| 16 keys: three separated; four held together with a twisted wire that comes through the holes at the top; another three held together with a ring of metal, and the last six are held all together in another ring of metal. There are 9 designs (how they are physically shapes) for the keys, some of which are repeated.

# Research

## The Starting Point
The starting point for researching items in the IISG archive was my cultural background and language. From the visits to the archive I found that they had an archive specified to the Spanish Civil War. Later, through researching I found out that this archive was actually for the CNT, a workers' union and one of the sides of the Civil War specifically.

Through the keywords "Spain" and "CNT" I found the box containing [16 keys and 16 stamps](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/COLL00156).  
I found out that these keys were originating from CNT owned buildings and vehicles, many of which were stolen by the Fascist side, or rather legay taken as the winning side of the war. From there, I came to discover the legal battle taking place still today on these previous belongings of the CNT.

# Transcoding
The transcodings focused on the following question: "What is a key?".
This not only made translating the existing keys themselves, breaking down their physicality, but also bring out the metaphorical aspects, different  types of keys as well as the story behind these keys.  

## Transcoding No. 1
### Description
Being unable to go to the IISG archive due to the COVID-19 crisis meant that I had to work with the images of the keys that I took on a previous visit. From these, I am able to get a lot of detail as I intentionally took great close ups.
It is important to state this because it means that all the following transcoding and data is derived from a copy of the original item, a reproduction. The data is from the reproduction itself rather than the keys as objects.  

This particular transcoding focused on the numerical metadata of the photos of the keys.

### Methods
In order to achieve this, I found online two tools that could provide me all the metadata on each image.

The first was [Image forensic](http://www.imageforensic.org/). From this, under the EXIF tab (exchangeable image file format) I was able to find the numerical data of each format for each image specifically.


### Tools
Mention the tools that you used or made (if and when relevant).

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc.

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for.

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  


# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)

## Bibliography
Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work.

<a name="footnote-1">**[1]**</a>: Look at this little referenced footnote over here. You can look up different text formats for referencing books, online articles, films etc.
