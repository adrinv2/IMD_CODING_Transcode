      <h1 id="about">ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        This project began with a box.
        <br>In that box there was an office drawer.
        <br>And in that drawer, sixteen stamps and sixteen keys.
        <br>
        <br>I went on to uncover a story full of social struggle, of blood and hate that very much affected my family history, just as it affected that of many Spanish citizens.
        <br>This project is about <b>remembrance</b>.
        <br>
        <br>The CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) is a still to date active labour union, that during the Spanish Civil war made up a part of the Republican side.
        When Franco became dictator, all information and history regarding the CNT was censored.
        <br>
        <br>This project is <b>not</b> to make ammends.
        <br>Political ammends were already made at the end of the Francoist regime, as well in 2004 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_of_Forgetting#Legal_basis" style= "text-decoration:underline; color:rgb(106, 5, 140);">new laws were passed to eradicate laws and court cases established during the regime</a>.
        <br>
        <br> This website compiles together multiple items from multiple archives. Starting with IISG in Amsterdam, to photo collections by the Arxieu Fotographic in Barcelona, and multiple finds from google. It brings all this content together and makes it available to the public.
        <br>

  In order to conduct a forensic image analysis, I first gathered images of the office interiors from the IISG archive.
</p>
   </div>
  <div id="gallery">  <img src='media/forensics1..png'>
    <p>
      In this image I highlighted the background furniture piece. It is a bookshelf with drawers and closets, a traditional 1800s office furniture piece. It stood out the most because it's permanence was most likely; it is a furniture piece that is antique and built into the space of the office itself. RIGHT: Extraction of furniture piece and highlighted identifiable details.

  Upon googling, I was able to find <a href= "https://www.foment.com/es/sobre-nosotros/sede-social/" style="text-decoration:underline; color:rgb(106, 5, 140);">an official website</a> that presented all the public rooms of the Foment del Treball Nacional. In that, I found this room was called "Historical Office of the General Secretary". I went on to google it, as well as googling general interiors of the building,and found this photograph. RIGHT: Highlighted details that match those of the photograph. The center piece between these two bookshelf sections also matches the one in the picture.

    <p>
    There was the potential that one of the keys had opened the drawer they were found in.
  </p> </div>
  <div id="gallery"> <img src='media/forensics1.5.png'>
       <p>
        I realised that the handle was missing, probably removed for the factor of transport. Or perhaps, it was broken to open the drawer. Perhaps the top part was broken too, forced, seeing as it is not a smooth rounded off edge.
        RIGHT: Potential knobs the drawer could have had.

    I selected images where similar office drawers could be seen.

  <div id="gallery">  <img src='media/forensics1.6.png'>
  <p>
    Here I highlighted these drawers that resembled the above examples.

      See here a more cropped version of the drawers.
