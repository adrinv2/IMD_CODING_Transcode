# Artefact
Sixteen keys scattered across a drawer that was yanked out suddenly from a CNT office in the heated fire of the Spanish Civil War, now confined in the safety of a cardboard box in the IISG, in Amsterdam. It was 1939, Barcelona. What did the keys open? What would they come to represent?

## Metadata
| Tag | Data |  
|--|--|
**IISG Call Number** | [IISG BG K21/985](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/1109411)
| **Physical Description** | 16 keys
| **Type** | Object
| **Medium** | Tool/device
| **Materials** | Copper, Steel, Iron
| **Date** | prior to 1936
|![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/keys5.png)| 16 keys: three separated; four held together with a twisted wire that comes through the holes at the top; another three held together with a ring of metal, and the last six are held all together in another ring of metal. There are 9 designs (how they are physically shapes) for the keys, some of which are repeated.

# Research

### The Starting Point
The starting point for researching items in the IISG archive was my cultural background and language. From the visits to the archive I found that they had an archive specified to the Spanish Civil War. Later, through researching I found out that this archive was actually for the CNT, a workers' union and one of the sides of the Civil War specifically.

Through the keywords "Spain" and "CNT" I found the box containing [16 keys and 16 stamps](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/COLL00156).  
I found out that these keys were originating from CNT owned buildings and vehicles, many of which were stolen by the Fascist side, or rather legay taken as the winning side of the war. From there, I came to discover the legal battle taking place still today on these previous belongings of the CNT.

Photographs of the items at the archive:

### Origin of the items**

  ![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/address.png)

  There were office documents in which the stamps were tested, found in the same box as the keys and stamps. The address at the top states where all these items came from; "Avenida B. Durruti 32-34". I researched the address but it no longer existed; Durruti was the name of a war hero, who died during the Civil War, and the street was renamed after him in commemoration, after his death during that time. This was also a give away it wouldn't exist any longer.

  I searched it in google maps, and indeed it was not there anymore. However, I did know it was in Barcelona because the IISG states that the boxes came from the offices in said city.

  ![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/default.jpg)

  Upon searching for the address, on google, I found this document which states that Avenue B Durruti was previously called Layetana. So I searched the same address, changing "Avenida B. Durruti" for "Layetana".

  ![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/Untitled.png)
    *This was the google maps result of the address.*

  ![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/11.jpg)
    *This was a photo I retrieved personally from the archive, on the anniversary of Durruti's death. The banner set up in the front of the building commemorates him. This was the second anniversary, on November of 1938.*

  ![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/13.jpg)
    *Another picture retrieved from the IISG archive that shows the main entrance to the building.*

  The building itself was previously an employers' organisation -the national-, rather than the workers. The CNT requisitioned it in 1936 and made it the headquarters in Barcelona. After the war, Franco prohibited the CNT and anything in link with it, and returned the building to its original owners, that nowadays still own it. Now and prior to the CNT, the building goes by the name ["Fomento del Trabajo Nacional"](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomento_del_Trabajo_Nacional).

### Other archive material

# Transcoding
The transcodings focused on the following question: "What is a key?".
This not only made translating the existing keys themselves, breaking down their physicality, but also bring out the metaphorical aspects, different  types of keys as well as the story behind these keys.  

## Transcoding No. 1
### Description
This first transcoding was a literal translation of what the keys possibly are. These are all hypothesised, based on research, given that the keys could not be analysed chemically.

### Methods
For this analysis, I had to base my theories on research. A lot of it was researching the materials of what different keys would be made of. This was based on researching what the keys were to begin with; a car key, the key of a lock of a furniture piece, the age of the key, if the key was stamped out as a copy, ... To know this, I researched the different shapes of the keys, writing on them or other symbols, and spoke to people who dealt with antiques and knew about older keys and locks.

Additionally, I measured half of them the one time I visited the IISG. Based on the measurements I took, and crossing this information with the proportion the keys have proportionally to one another based on a picture (see the [Metadata](#metadata) for the image), I was able to guess the missing measurements. I did the measuring on InDesign after proportionally resizing the images.

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/process.png)

### Tools
Google, interviews, visual research based on previous knowlegde. Analysing images visually by zooming in, picture viewer. Indesign.

### Results
- Car keys - Steel
- Older keys - Iron
- Newer keys - Brass

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/measurements.png)



## Transcoding No. 2
### Description
Being unable to go to the IISG archive due to the COVID-19 crisis meant that I had to work with the images of the keys that I took on a previous visit. From these, I am able to get a lot of detail as I intentionally took great close ups.
It is important to state this because it means that all the following transcoding and data is derived from a copy of the original item, a reproduction. The data is from the reproduction itself rather than the keys as objects.  

This particular transcoding focused on the numerical metadata of the photos of the keys, that is the EXIF data of the photo itself.

### Methods
In order to achieve this, I found online two tools that could provide me all the metadata on each image.

The first was [Image forensic](http://www.imageforensic.org/). From this, under the EXIF tab (exchangeable image file format) I was able to find the numerical data of each format for each image specifically. The Exchangeable Image File Format is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras, in this case providing metadata of the image as well as additional information.

Under the EXIF tab, I scrolled down to the numerical data of the "photo" section, rather than the camera and other settings. From this numerical data the photo can be recomposed.


### Tools
The tool I used for this was [Image forensic](http://www.imageforensic.org/).

## Transcoding No. 3
### Description
This particular transcoding focused around photo forensics. This means to analyse the visual aspects of the image based on a superficial way by looking over the image and cross-comparing to other images.

### Methods
After researching into photo forensics, I found this project that through analysing video footage and images, alongside recreating spaces in Augmented Reality, they were able to recreate a bombing that occurred in Douma, Syria and find out if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for it. [Here you can see the investigation.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-douma.html)

This inspired me to conduct an investigation of my own, linking the keys to the objects they could have potentially belonged to, based off of a series of photographs that I collected from the IISG archive. These photographs were also sent from the same office that these keys came from, and most of these were taken within the offices of the [Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, in Barcelona](#Origin-of-the-items).

From the images I gathered, I chose only the photographs that were interiors of the Foment del Nacianal (Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, National Work/Labour Promotion), showing offices. We know the keys came in an office drawer.

### Tools
Google, photoviewer, Photoshop.

### Results
![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/offices.png)  
  *All images of the office interiors.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1..png)  
  *In this image I highlighted the background furniture piece. It is a bookshelf with drawers and closets, a traditional 1800s office furniture piece. It stood out the most because it's permanence was most likely; it is a furniture piece that is antique and built into the space of the office itself. RIGHT: Extraction of furniture piece and highlighted identifiable details.*


![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1.2.png)    
  *Upon googling, I was able to find an official [website](https://www.foment.com/es/sobre-nosotros/sede-social/) that presented all the public rooms of the Foment del Treball Nacional. In that, I found this room was called "Historical Office of the General Secretary". I went on to google it, as well as googling general interiors of the building,and found this photograph. RIGHT: Highlighted details that match those of the photograph. The center piece between these two bookshelf sections also matches the one in the picture.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1.4.png)   
*There was the potential that one of the keys had opened the drawer they were found in.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1.5.png)  
*I realised that the handle was missing, probably removed for the factor of transport. Or perhaps, it was broken to open the drawer. Perhaps the top part was broken too, forced, seeing as it is not a smooth rounded off edge. RIGHT: Potential knobs the drawer could have had.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1.3.png)   
*I selected images where similar office drawers could be seen.*  

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/forensics1.6.png)   
*Here I highlighted these drawers that resembled the above examples.*

## Transcoding No. 4
### Description
This transcoding focused on the metaphorical, the story a key could carry attached to it. Specifically this reflected on Sephardi Jews in Spain.


### Methods
**Who are the Sephardi Jews?**

The Sephardi Jews are Jews that lived in Spain and were expelled by the Catholic Kings (Ferdinand and Isabella) in the 15th century.

They kept keys that belonged to their homes and mosques, and passed them on from generation to generation with the story of origin. Both the story and keys, like so, tied them back to their roots.

Recently, in autumn of 2019, around 132, 000 descendants were able to apply for a Spanish citizenship. The Spanish government offered this opportunity as a means to make up for this historical wrong.

These keys are said to have been given by Jews and Muslims, respectively, to Ferdinand III when he took Seville in 1248. "*

> *Salvador Espriu, a Catholic and one of the great Catalonian poets and novelists of the 20th century, used the Hebrew word Sepharad as a metaphor for Spain. He came of age as an artist during the Spanish Civil War and the dictatorship of Franco. For him, Sepharad stood for an ideal of justice that endured beyond the cruelty and intolerance that has plagued Spanish history. Espriu evoked the exile of the Jews and the yearning for a homecoming as a way of articulating his own voice as an ‚Äúexile,‚Äù a critic of oppression in his own land.*

>*In the 1960s, he wrote a poem titled La Pell de Brau (‚ÄúThe Bull-Hide‚Äù) that captures the radical hope of reconciliation that spurs me on my journey of return.*

> *So, when someone
asks us
sometimes, in a harsh voice:
‚ÄúWhy have you stayed
here in this hard, dry land,
this land soaked in blood?
This is surely not the best of the lands you came upon
in the long
trial
of your Exile‚Äù‚Äîwith a small smile
that remembers our fathers
and our grandfathers, we only say:
‚ÄúIn our dreams, yes, it is.‚Äù*

## Transcoding Tool
### Description
Upon researching the CNT, at the beginning of this project, it became apparent to me that their historical presence (during the Spanish Civil War) was lacking both online and in Spain itself. Being the losing side of the war, in some aspects it made sense, particularly since Franco then imposed a dictatorship up until 1975. Therefore, the presence and remembrance of the CNT during that time would have just sparked more tensions, and so he attempted to remove it.

After the dictatorship ended, a new pact was drawn up by both leftist and rightist political parties to forget the legacy of Franco and not follow it. It was called the Pact of Forgetting (_Pacto del Olvido_), under the basis of the Spanish Amnesty Law.

In 2004, socialist prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero drafted up the Historical Memory Law. It rejected the legitimacy of laws and trials that took place under the Francoist regime, and removed any remaining symbols of Franco from buildings.

I do not want to challenge these legal pacts, I do not wish to prosecute Franco and the events during his regime, but with my tool I want to bring back the presence and remembrance of the CNT, from a human stand point. I want to bring the collection of CNT at the IISG a little closer to Spanish people, given that the CNT still to this day cannot host and maintain the items of the archive. A platform to make this information available.


### Aims
As mentioned above, my tool was a website that would allow the user to unlock information by navigating and clicking these 16 keys. The information are a collection of research from my project; photographs of the IISG, other photographs found online, stories, etc.

### Methods
First I assigned the keys to different material:

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/ADRIANANV_plan.png)

Then I proceeded to sketch the website:

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/web.png)

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/sketchweb.png)

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/sketchweb3.png)


As part of the process, I gathered codes I took from the metadata of the keys themselves. And so using this code, I assigned a keyword to each (which would become then my tagging system for the website).

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/codes.png)
*LEFT: The codes assigned per keyword.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/codesinuse.png)  
*ABOVE: The codes assigned to the keywords in use.*

![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/bandera.jpg)
![](https://github.com/adrinv2/IMD_CODING_Transcode/blob/master/assets/images/cntbandera.png)    
 My choice for the colours of the website come from the Spanish Republican flag, since the CNT was part of the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War (yellow and purple). The colours I originally had were of the CNT but aesthetically did not work well (originally had red and black).

# Reflection
Reflecting on this project and the outcomes, I am proud and like the final outcome of the website. It is an easy way to make this information available online since my aim from the beginning was making all this information more widely available.

I would have liked to have done more physical outcomes, which were my original plan. 3D printed keys as part of performance, verbal storytelling, physical moulds of the keys themselves... Of course, this was not possible due to COVID-19 crisis, which pushed me to more digital mediums. Hence, I discarded many potential outcomes but have kept note of them for future projects/ideas.

To further this, had I had the time, I would have made a version in Spanish so that Spanish citizens could access all the information available.

# Outcomes
A website that compiles information about the CNT in relation to loss of property, giving a meaning to sixteen keys found in the IISG archive. Should be run on Chrome, on a Windows computer ideally. The user can use the filters to sort out information they wish to see, as well as click specific links to analyse this information more closely.

# Conclusion
I enjoyed the research of this project very much, since it allowed me to go thoroughly about finding information and content. I also the website coding aspect, bringing together everything that I have learnt in the past.
