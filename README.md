## The Physical Items

### Starting Point
The starting point for researching items in the IISG archive was my cultural background and language. From the visits to the archive I found that they had an archive specified to the Spanish Civil War. Later, through researching I found out that this archive was actually for the CNT, a workers' union and one of the sides of the Civil War specifically.

Through the keywords "Spain" and "CNT" I found the box containing [16 keys and 16 stamps](https://search.iisg.amsterdam/Record/COLL00156).  
I found out that these keys were originating from CNT owned buildings and vehicles, many of which were stolen by the Fascist side, or rather legally taken as the winning side of the war. From there, I came to discover the legal battle taking place still today on these previous belongings of the CNT.

### Origin of the items

![](/assets/images/address.png)

There were office documents in which the stamps were tested, found in the same box as the keys and stamps. The address at the top states where all these items came from; "Avenida B. Durruti 32-34". I researched the address but it no longer existed; Durruti was the name of a war hero, who died during the Civil War, and the street was renamed after him in commemoration, after his death during that time. This was also a give away it wouldn't exist any longer.

I searched it in google maps, and indeed it was not there anymore. However, I did know it was in Barcelona because the IISG states that the boxes came from the offices in said city.

![](/assets/images/default.jpg)

Upon searching for the address, on google, I found this document which states that Avenue B Durruti was previously called Layetana. So I searched the same address, changing "Avenida B. Durruti" for "Layetana".

![](/assets/images/Untitled.png)
This was the google maps result of the address.

![](/assets/images/11.jpg)
This was a photo I retrieved personally from the archive, on the anniversary of Durruti's death. The banner set up in the front of the building commemorates him. This was the second anniversary, on November of 1938.

![](/assets/images/13.jpg)
Another picture retrieved from the IISG archive that shows the main entrance to the building.

The building itself was previously an employers' organisation -the national-, rather than the workers. The CNT requisitioned it in 1936 and made it the headquarters in Barcelona. After the war, Franco prohibited the CNT and anything in link with it, and returned the building to its original owners, that nowadays still own it. Now and prior to the CNT, the building goes by the name ["Fomento del Trabajo Nacional"](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomento_del_Trabajo_Nacional).

### Lists of properties

**Lists of returned property (objects and buildings)**

*These lists are NOT from the IISG archive, but from "Instituto del Patrimonio Cultural" archive of Spain (trans: Institute of Cultural Heritage).["Here are more of those lists"](https://www.notion.so/Lists-of-properties-a40bbe37997642c1bdb1b07cdef0f5b6)*

## The Keys of the Sephardi Jews

### Who are the Sephardi Jews?

The Sephardi Jews are Jews that lived in Spain and were expelled by the Catholic Kings (Ferdinand and Isabella) in the 15th century.

They kept keys that belonged to their homes and mosques, and passed them on from generation to generation with the story of origin. Both the story and keys, like so, tied them back to their roots.

Recently, in autumn of 2019, around 132, 000 descendants were able to apply for a Spanish citizenship. The Spanish government offered this opportunity as a means to make up for this historical wrong.

>*"Llave con la expresión castellana en mayúsculas latinas: «Dios abrirá, rey entrará», y compañera con la expresión árabe en cúfico: «al-Amr kullu-hu li-Ll×h» (Todo el poder pertenece a Dios), con la segunda palabra encabalgada al final de la primera. Se dice que estas llaves fueron entregadas por judíos y musulmanes, respectivamente, a Fernando III cuando tomó Sevilla en 1248."*

Trans: *"Key with the Castilian expression in Latin capitals:« God will open, the king will enter », and a companion with the Arabic expression in Kufic:« al-Amr kullu-hu li-Ll × h »(All power belongs to God), with the second word hooded at the end of the first. These keys are said to have been given by Jews and Muslims, respectively, to Ferdinand III when he took Seville in 1248. "*

> *Salvador Espriu, a Catholic and one of the great Catalonian poets and novelists of the 20th century, used the Hebrew word Sepharad as a metaphor for Spain. He came of age as an artist during the Spanish Civil War and the dictatorship of Franco. For him, Sepharad stood for an ideal of justice that endured beyond the cruelty and intolerance that has plagued Spanish history. Espriu evoked the exile of the Jews and the yearning for a homecoming as a way of articulating his own voice as an “exile,” a critic of oppression in his own land.*

>*In the 1960s, he wrote a poem titled La Pell de Brau (“The Bull-Hide”) that captures the radical hope of reconciliation that spurs me on my journey of return.*

> *So, when someone
asks us
sometimes, in a harsh voice:
“Why have you stayed
here in this hard, dry land,
this land soaked in blood?
This is surely not the best of the lands you came upon
in the long
trial
of your Exile”—with a small smile
that remembers our fathers
and our grandfathers, we only say:
“In our dreams, yes, it is.”*

# Transcoding list
*Key questions: what do I want to say with this method of transcoding? Intention. What medium do I want to work in? Do I want to make an interactive site in the end where the user navigates and unlocks these paths?*  
*What is a key? What does it do, what does it represent?*

1. **Photogrammetry of keys (include both folder with images + file to 3D print)**
+ **PROS:** Anyone can have it to their disposal to download the file, and if the file becomes outdated, then the images to compose it.  
+ **CONS:** If I make an interactive website, then the file sizes might be too big. !!**Tool for compressing these?**!! Currently: cannot go to archive to make models of these. Therefore, make versions at home + make models out of photographs of keys.    


2. **Moulds of keys (physical)**
+ **PROS:** Can potentially survive longer than the object itself, can produce many keys, hence it has less probability of ceasing to exist, unlike a single key itself.  
+ **CONS:** Would have to be a durable material, not just physical. Take up more space than a key, takes up physical space in an archive. Has to also be done with materials that will not damage the keys (silicone two part).   

3. **In depth technical description of the keys (analytical)**
+ **PROS:** This description is very detail, less likely to mistake it for something vague. Avoids miscommunication.  
+ **CONS:** Would it have to be in Spanish too? Caution to not make it biased. Details may be lost in translation.  

4. **Narrative storytelling (emotional aspect of the story behind the keys)**
+ **PROS:** People get an emotional connection from an item that would otherwise be emotionless.  
+ **CONS:** How to not make the mistake of painting the CNT as the good guy of the Civil War, when both sides were almost equally damaging and bad in war?

# Transcodings

## Literal Transcodings

#### Materials of the keys
  - Car keys - Steel
  - Older keys - Iron
  - Newer keys - Brass

The following measurements and details are taken from a mixture of photographs and some sketches done in the single visit to the IISG archive, prior to the covid-19 crisis. Therefore, some of the measurements are hypothesised based on measurements that were recorded (9 out of the 16 keys) and using photographs as reference for the proportion.

## Metadata derived from images

Being unable to go to the IISG archive due to the COVID-19 crisis meant that I had to work with the images of the keys that I took on a previous visit. From these, I am able to get a lot of detail as I intentionally took great close ups. It is important to say this because it means that all the following transcoding and data is derived from a copy of the original item, a reproduction. The data is from the reproduction itself rather than the keys as objects.  

I found online two tools that could provide me all the metadata on each image.

The first was [Image forensic](http://www.imageforensic.org/). From this, under the EXIF tab (exchangeable image file format) I was able to find the numerical data of each format for each image specifically.

![](/assets/images/keys/JPEG/DSC_0156.jpg)
*This was the input image.*

![](/assets/images/imageforensic.png)
*The outcome after being processed.*

![](/assets/images/numericaldata.png)
*One section of numerical data derived from the EXIF tab/section.*

![](/assets/images/morenumbers.png)
*Another section of metadata from the EXIF tab, in regards to this specific image (Image capture done at 25% zoom of the original page)*.

What I could do is provide the metadata of the photographs, for each key, so that the image could then be reproduced and from that the image could be composed again when, and if, the file itself becomes corrupt. For this I then to find the process in which the metadata can be pieced back together.



## Photo Forensics

After researching into photo forensics, I found this project that through analysing video footage and images, alongside recreating spaces in Augmented Reality, they were able to recreate a bombing that occurred in Douma, Syria and find out if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for it. [Here you can see the investigation.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/world/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-douma.html)

This inspired me to conduct an investigation of my own, linking the keys to the objects they could have potentially belonged to, based off of a series of photographs that I collected from the IISG archive. These photographs were also sent from the same office that these keys came from, and most of these were taken within the offices of the [Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, in Barcelona](#Origin-of-the-items).

From the images I gathered, I chose only the photographs that were interiors of the Foment del Nacianal (Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, National Work/Labour Promotion), showing offices. We know the keys came in an office drawer.

![](assets/images/offices.png)  
*All images of the office interiors.*

![](assets/images/picbg.png)  
*In this image I highlighted the background furniture piece. It is a bookshelf with drawers and closets, a traditional 1800s office furniture piece. It stood out the most because it's permanence was most likely; it is a furniture piece that is antique and built into the space of the office itself.*

![](assets/images/picbg2.png)  
*Detail of the furniture piece extracted.*

![](assets/images/picbg3.png)  
*Key features of the furniture piece, highlighted, as to identify it in other pictures.*

![](assets/images/furniturepiece.jpg)  
*Upon googling, I was able to find an official [website](https://www.foment.com/es/sobre-nosotros/sede-social/) that presented all the public rooms of the Foment del Treball Nacional. In that, I found this room was called "Historical Office of the General Secretary". I went on to google it, as well as googling general interiors of the building,and found this photograph.*

![](assets/images/furniturepiece2.jpg)  
*Here highlighted the same shapes that were identified in the photograph. The center piece between these two bookshelf sections also matches the one in the picture.*

# Transcoding tool

These are potential concepts and ideas of what the transcoding tool could be.

- A platform where all this information is accessible.

    Using the [assignation system of each key to a set of information](#what-each-key-is-assigned-to) in combination with the [measurements of the physical key's teeth](#literal-transcoding) I would produce a database where all this data can be unlocked.
